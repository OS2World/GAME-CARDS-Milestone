Milestone Source

Random thoughts:
- Milestone was a game ported from source originally by David Addison in Amiga A-basic.
  The original port was to Turbo pascal, with another port to OS/2 in Speed/2 pascal.
  This was one of the few complete programs I did in Speed/2 (most of the others were
  utilities I uses/use in my system).
- The main window is hidden and closes when the game dialog is exited.  I couldn't (at
  the time) figure out a slick way to create the dialog using the Speed/2 dialog
  editor and use it for the main window.  The hidden main window represents the best
  I could come up with.
- The program was modified after Warp 4 came out with the voice navigation system.  It
  works real well with that system.
- Included was my first attempt at creating on-line OS/2 help.  This help has been 
  modified recently as I got a hold of the warp toolkit finally (in the MCP package)
  with some additional features I didn't have originally.
- Have fun with the source...
